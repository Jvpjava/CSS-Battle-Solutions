# CSS-Battle-Solutions
The objective of the game is to write HTML/CSS to replicate the given target image in the least code possible.

In the target page, start coding in the editor area on the left. As you start typing, the output area in the middle will start rendering your code. When you're confident that the output matches the target image, hit the Submit button to see your score.

Important points to Note:
What you write in the editor, renders as it is. We make no change. This means you don't even get the DOCTYPE
Since this is "CSS" battle, you are not allowed to use JavaScript or images in your code. In fact any external asset is not allowed. All code required to generate the target image has to be written in the given editor only.
Now go and climb the leaderboards!
